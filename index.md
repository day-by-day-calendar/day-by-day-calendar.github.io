It’s that time of the year when organization-oriented Android users can reap the harvest of successful time management. Day by Day is a time management app designed to combine **Google Calendar** and **Google Tasks** in one package for Android phones and tablets.

No more long paper to-do lists, forgotten birthdays and missed events. The app we‘ve developed can be used as a diary for household, a day planner and even a smart personal assistant.

With the help of this time management tool you can keep track of schedule, using any Android device connected to Internet.

Day by Day app has lots to offer:

* presentation of events and tasks in one list;
* sync with Google Calendar and Google Tasks;
* incorporation of your contacts’ birthdays into the common list;
* different calendar views - agenda, month view, text month view, text week view, day view;
* interactive widget for businesslike users;
* configurable widget layout;
* birthday reminder;
* voice input;
* search function;
* text month widget, week widget;
* ability to use different calendar profiles in widgets and the app;
* invitations for calendar events and check of guest list;
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm" target="_blank">Tasker</a> app is supported for better business management. E.g. you can have a task reminder to go off when you come to work;
* subtasks or todo lists in your events and tasks to write down business ideas or daily routine;
* rich set of options for recurrent tasks;
* priority in tasks to differentiate between more and less important business or routine tasks;
* users can share text information from another app with Day by Day calendar, for example, when creating task or event.

Day by Day allows you to create the events with fixed start/end time, as well as the events due to a certain time with the ability to postpone it. When creating an event, you are prompted to set a reminder which won’t let you forget about your plans.

This time management app is so simple that no further explanation is actually needed, just download and enjoy!
