                <h3>9. Period for Bringing Actions</h3>

                <p>9.1. No action, regardless of form, arising out of the transactions under this Agreement, may be
                    brought by either party hereto more than one (1) year after the cause of action has occurred, or was
                    discovered to have occurred, except that an action for infringement of intellectual property rights
                    may be brought within the maximum applicable statutory period.</p>



                <h3>10. Entire Agreement; Severability; No Waiver</h3>

                <p>10.1. This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Rightholder and supersedes any other
                    prior agreements, proposals, communications or advertising, oral or written, with respect to the
                    Software or to subject matter of this Agreement. You acknowledge that you have read this Agreement,
                    understand it and agree to be bound by its terms. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a
                    court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable for any reason, in whole or in
                    part, such provision will be more narrowly construed so that it becomes legal and enforceable, and
                    the entire Agreement will not fail on account thereof and the balance of the Agreement will continue
                    in full force and effect to the maximum extent permitted by law or equity while preserving, to the
                    fullest extent possible, its original intent. No waiver of any provision or condition herein shall
                    be valid unless in writing and signed by you and an authorized representative of Rightholder
                    provided that no waiver of any breach of any provisions of this Agreement will constitute a waiver
                    of any prior, concurrent or subsequent breach. Rightholder's failure to insist upon or enforce
                    strict performance of any provision of this Agreement or any right shall not be construed as a
                    waiver of any such provision or right.</p>
